A C# application designed to track a user's coding habits.

Console based CRUD application to track time spent coding. Developed using C# and SQLite.

The user is able to input new rows for how often they have coded for the day. You are also able to update or delete these records if you so choose.
In addition, if you'd like to wipe the entire database, go for it, but be careful!

There is a timer feature that allows the user to start a timer and go off on their day. Once they are ready to submit their coding time, they
can simply turn off the timer and it is recorded to their database.
